# Indecision

This is a simple app that allows the user to enter some choices they're struggling to decide between,
and let the computer make the decision!

## Usage

To install and run Indecision on your local server, clone the repo first:

`git clone git@github.com:lord-of-yoghurt/indecision-react.git`

Then, install all the dependencies. I have avoided using global dependencies, so everything this app needs
will be installed locally.

`npm install`

Finally, run the npm task that starts the Webpack dev server:

`npm run dev-server`

The app will load on your localhost:8080.

Stack:

- React.JS with Webpack
- HTML
- SCSS
