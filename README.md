# Indecision

This is a simple app that allows the user to enter some choices they're struggling to decide between,
and let the computer make the decision! The app is fully responsive, and it uses simple data persistence
via JavaScript's `localStorage`.

## Usage

To install and run Indecision on your local server, clone the repo first:

`git clone git@github.com:lord-of-yoghurt/indecision-react.git`

Then, install all the dependencies. I have avoided using global dependencies, so everything this app needs
will be installed locally.

`npm install`

Finally, run the npm task that starts the Webpack dev server:

`npm run dev-server`

The app will load on your localhost:8080.
